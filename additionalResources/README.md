# Additional Resources

This section provides additional information, will get you up to speed with the prerequisite knowledge and the setup.

## Prerequisites and setup

Before you start the workshop you need to have the required hardware and software installed and have your IBM public cloud account.  Full details can be found on the [Setup](PREREQUISITES_AND_SETUP.md) page

## IOT Starter App

In part 3 you will send sensor data across the mesh network to the IBM Cloud.  You have to deploy an IoT starter application on the IBM cloud to receive the data.  Full instructions to deploy the application and the IBM IoT platform can be found [here](IOT_STARTER_APP.md)

## Headless setup

When setting up a Raspberry Pi you need to access the Pi to do the initial setup.  This is usually done by connecting a keyboard, mouse and monitor to the Pi.  However, it is possible to setup the pi using a computer without needing to connect the keyboard, mouse and monitor.  This is known as a headless setup.  Full details can be found on doing a headless setup on [this page](HEADLESS_SETUP.md)

## Command line access to a Raspberry Pi

Throughout the workshop you need to get access to the command line of the Raspberry Pi board that make up the mesh network.  [this page](COMMAND_LINE_ACCESS.md) provides information how to do this from Linux, MacOS and Windows systems
